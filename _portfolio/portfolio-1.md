title: "Interest Rate Volatility Regime Classification"
excerpt: "Financial markets have the tendency to change their behavior over time, which can create regimes or periods of fairly persistent market conditions…Modeling various market regimes…can enable macroeconomically aware investment decision-making and better management of tail risks.We also use the Markov Switching Dynamic Regression model to quantitatively describes the dynamic behavior of interest rate volatility with different maturity in the presence of structural breaks or regime changes.The results proved the MS-DR model to be useful, to evaluate the characteristics of volatility regimes across the yield curve.<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
